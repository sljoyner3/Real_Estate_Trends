    Welcome! While the U.S. housing market has seen steady growth and increasing prices in recent decades, it can still be subject
    to quick change and rapid periods of growth and recession. Many of these periods can be tied to notable events in U.S. history,
    particularly those with significant economic effects. This project seeks to analyze the U.S. real estate market and correlate
    periods of growth and regression- determined by sales price, number of houses listed, and number of houses sold - to major 
    events that have occurred in the past few decades including the Cold War, 2008 Housing Crash and subsequent Great Recession, and 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic. 
    Through visualization I will identify how the real estate market changed in regions across the U.S. in response to these events. 
    To summarize these goals, I have outlined five specific research questions for this project:
    
    <ol type="1">
        <li> How did the U.S. housing market change during the Cold War, and which regions saw the most impact? </li>
        <li> How did the U.S. housing market change during the Housing Crash of 2008 and subsequent Great Reccision,
            and which regions saw the most impact? </li>
        <li> How did the U.S. housing market change during the COVID-19 Pandemic, and which 
            regions saw the most impact? </li>
        <li> What other major economic events or factors have affected or correlate with major shifts in the 
            housing market? </li>
        <li> Which regions have the seen the most growth across the entire span in terms of price, listings, and sales? </li>

    </ol>
