    This project set out with five distinct research questions to answer, and this section applies the work done in the 
    data and methods sections to those five questions.

    <br><br>

    <b> How did the U.S. housing market change during the Cold War, and which regions saw the most impact? </b>
    <br> The Cold War began following WWII and came to an end starting in the late 1980s, coming to complete resolve with the collapse of the 
    USSR in December of 1991. This conflict affected U.S. foreign and domestic policy, and through this it impacted the U.S. economy, potentially
    affecting the housing market as well.
    The following plots show median new home sale prices, the number of new houses sold per year, and number of new homes for sale at the end of a given year
    from 1973 to 1991. (Note that the y-scale's are not necessarily tuned for each individual graph, but this is intentionally done so that all similar plots throughout the results
    have the same scale and the reader can quickly see how variable values compared between questions.)

    We can see that house prices increase steadily in all regions from 1973 until 1984, at which point the Northeast region, followed closely by the West, 
    began to see relatively greater increases in median sale price. The following map illustrates the regional changes in median new home sale price from
    1984 to 1991.
    
    <br><br>

    <br><br>

    New home listings and sales went up and down from 1973 to 1984, but 
    for the most part the all moved in sync and each individual segment largely mirrored the U.S. overall trends, indicated that these patterns were 
    likely cyclical. Looking once again from 1984 up to 1991, the Northeast has an interesting sudden rise and fall in new home listings,
    peaking in 1988, but new houses sold actually decreased at this same time in the region. The sudden fall makes sense as sales were not there to
    support the rapid increase, but the increase itself is somewhat interesting. The following maps shown the change in new home sales and listings from 1984 
    to 1988.

    The spike likely indicates a predicted uptick in movement to this region and developers trying to get ahead of the market, and could be a result of a strong
    economy as the Cold War was clearly coming to an end by this point with the USSR beginning to collapse.

    <br><br>

    These graphics suggest that while home prices rose towards the end of the Cold War, particularly in the Northeast
    and Western U.S., new home listings and sales both saw little net increase or even a net decrease from 1984 to 1991. The South
    saw a particular decrease in listings from 1984 to 1991, but they still had the highest value at every year in this span, so the 
    market was likely getting saturated as new home sales decreased, leading to the decrease in listings. Extrapolating the new housing
    segment to the U.S. housing market as whole, the Cold War did lead to some interesting changes and a general increase in home prices,
    particularly towards the end of the war as this effected the economy and lead to overall stronger economy which typically boosts home
    prices and values.

    <br><br>

    <b> How did the U.S. housing market change during the Housing Crash of 2008 and subsequent Great Reccession,
        and which regions saw the most impact? </b> <br>
    The 2008 Housing Crash, as the name suggets, had a major impact on the housing market from 2008 into the early 2010s. Leading
    into the crash the housing market was growing at unprecedented rates, largely due to subprime mortgages, and this led to many new 
    houses being built, listed, and sold to meet the increasing demand.
    High numbers of new homes being listed and sold in the mid-2000s indicate a strong market with houses quickly selling for 
    relatively high (and increasing) prices, and looking
    at the median you can see that each region comes to a gradual peak around 2006, and then decreases towards the end of the decade,
    although interestingly prices in the Northeast region did not gradually decrease like every other region, and instead
    fluctuated up and down. The crash itself occurred in 2008 as default rates on subprime mortgages rapidly increased, leading to 
    significant problems for banks that were financing these loans.

    Just before the crash, new home listings and sales were at their maximum values over the entire 1973 to 2021 span, 
    and median new home prices were increasing as well. This indicates the strength of the 
    market prior to the crash, and how much demand there was for new homes, and by extension, homes in general.
    <br><br>
    Going back to median prices, the following map shows the change in median new home sale price from 2006 to 2009, 
    a year after the crash and subsequent recession, and as recovery was beginning.
    <br><br>
    <embed src="resources/visuals/Median_2006_2009.html" class="img-center" style="width: 60%; min-height: 450px;">
    <br><br>
    At this point the Western region had seen the biggest decrease of -21.91%, and although all regions saw a decrease 
    in this span the South had the least decrease at -6.44%, although looking at the line plot they did not actually hit 
    their peak until 2007. It is also interesting to look at the change in new houses sold and listed over this same period.

    The decreases with these metrics are much more dramatic than the median price decrease. The number of new homes sold and number of new homes listed both 
    took a big hit nationwide. As the housing market crash developers were discontinuing projects and not willing to start new ones since there was significant risk and not 
    much potential for profit. This limited the new homes that were even available to be bought, and besides this constraint many individuals were not buying homes at this point,
    as even though prices were lower the economy was failing as a whole and people generally did not have the resources to purchase a home at this time. 
    <br><br>
    These plots and maps highlight how the 2008 Housing Crash had swift effects on the housing market, particularly effecting the new home segment since developers 
    did not have confidence in the market and did not want to begin new projects at this time. This affected all of the regions, although
    the West took a particularly large hit to new home median sale prices, and every region was down 50% or more in new homes listed and sold.

    <br><br>

    <b> How did the COVID-19 Pandemic affect the U.S. housing market, and which 
        regions saw the most impact? </b> <br>
    The 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic had an interesting effect on the housing market. Amid stay-at-home orders and the rise of remote work
    people began to spend more time at home, generally increasing needs for space in their homes. Additionally, with the economy slowing down
    due to pandemic, interest rates were lowered, making it, on paper, a good time for people to buy new houses. The plots below show the three variables
    from 2015, five years prior to the pandemic, to 2021 when the pandemic was in full swing.

    Median new home sale prices was fairly stagnant prior to the pandemic, but from 2020 to 2021 there is a sharp increase 
    in values across all regions. New home listings also increased, particularly in the South, however, new home sales did not significantly 
    increase and actually slightly decreased nationwide from 2020 to 2021.
    <br><br>
    An interesting element of COVID's effect on the housing market is that the introduction of remote work has made it possible for individuals to 
    move to new locations away from their offices and potentially major urban areas. This makes the regional analysis much more interesting 
    to see what regions may have a seen a corresponding uptick in sales and listings. New home sales remained roughly the same for all regions, but 
    I wanted to focus on new home listings since these 
    new developments are built based on market research and likely indicate where people are looking to move, and new home sales in future years
    may mirror the current increases in new home listings. The map on the left shows the change in new home listings from 2020 to 2021, while 
    the map on the right simply shows the number of new homes listed for sale at the end of 2021.
    
    <br><br>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column2">
            <embed src="resources/visuals/Listed_2020_2021.html" class="img-center" style="width: 100%; min-height: 450px;">

    <br><br>

    The South had the greatest one year increase in new home listings with 32.53% jump, however, all regions saw
    at least a 20% increase in this metric from 2020 to 2021. The South also had the most new homes listed at the end of 2021 
    with 227,000 available units, followed distantly by the West region with 93,000 listed new homes. This seems to 
    indicate that developers are focusing their efforts in the South, and this could be for several reasons, including
    affordability and land costs, and predict demand and anticipated movement. Given that this is still an ongoing event, it would be interesting to check
    in a few years to see if new homes sold changed to reflect the increased in new home listings.

    <br><br>

    The COVID-19 Pandemic increased prices fairly uniformly across all regions, and new home sales remained stagnant or saw slight decreases
    through
    2021. New home listings, however, increased greatly, particularly in the Southern region. Seeing this change, and overall 
    increase it could be anticipated that new home sales would spike as these units are purchased. It is also possible, however,

    <br><br>

    <b> What other major economic events or factors have affected or correlate with major shifts in the 
        housing market? </b>
        <br>
    The three events addressed above cover most of the time period studied, but there are two general ranges that
    are left out: the early 1990s to early 2000s, and early 2010s to late 2010s. 

    <br><br>
    <div class="row">

    Looking at median new home sale prices from 1991 to 2001 and from 2010 to 2020 paints a similar picture for both spans:
    constant, yet non-noteworthy, market growth. There were no major domestic effects occuring during these spans, although the 
    beginning of the U.S. military involvement in the Middle East during the 1990s and continuing economic recovery from the 2008 
    crash likely had some positive U.S. economic effect during these spans, these prices indicate just general positive market growth 
    during these spans.

    <br><br>

    <b> Which regions have the seen the most growth across the entire span in terms of price, listings, and sales? </b>

    <br><br>

    With regards to U.S. home prices, as measured by the median new house sale price for each region, 
    consider the map and plot below for evaluating change over the entire timeframe.
    <br><br>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column2">
          <embed src="resources/visuals/Median_1973_2021.html" class="img-center" style="width: 100%; min-height: 450px;">

    <br><br>
    These graphics show that there has been a significant increase in new home prices in the U.S., and this likely correlates
    to a major increase in U.S. overall home prices. The Northeast and West saw the greatest increases of just over 1400%,
    and this makes sense considering that within these regions are several major cities that are high cost of living areas including New York, Boston,
    San Francisco, and Los Angeles. However, the South and Midwest saw increases just over and just under 1000%, respectively, 
    indicating that housing costs have increased greatly in these areas as well. The line plot on the right shows that between the years,
    the price increase is not linear and instead us exponential, especially as of late. The plot also shows that there are time periods
    of rapid growth and decline during this span, but the net change was significant house price increases nationwide.

    <br><br>
    Below is a similar set of graphics for the change in the number of new homes sold in a year from 1973 to 2021.
    <br><br>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column2">
          <embed src="resources/visuals/Sold_1973_2021.html" class="img-center" style="width: 100%; min-height: 450px;">
        </div>
        <div class="column2">
         <img src="resources/visuals/House_Sales_1973_2021.jpg" style="width:100%">
        </div>
      </div>
    <br><br>
    These plots are interesting, because despite rapidly increasing prices two regions, the Northeast and Midwest, actually had 
    a net negative change in new houses sold, while the South and West both saw increases. The increases were mostly
    fueled by major jumps during the 1990s and 2000s prior to the housing crash, and then regaining some of this growth after the crash.
    Interestingly, the Northeast and Midwest never saw this growth of the 1990s and 2000s, and thus new home sales never significantly increased for either. 
    However, this is likely due to the Northeast already being very developed and expensive, as shown by median prices, leaving developers few untapped and profitable
    areas to build new homes. The Midwest likely has less change since there are less urban areas and profitable places to develop, and much 
    of the land is farmland that is not available for development. Given this context, it is possible that for these regions,
    new home sales do not mimic patterns in existing home sales.
    <br><br>
    Lastly, the following are overall graphics for the third metric I looked at, the number of new homes listed for sale at the end of a given year.
    
    <br><br>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column2">
          <embed src="resources/visuals/Listed_1973_2021.html" class="img-center" style="width: 100%; min-height: 450px;">

      </div>
    <br><br>
    Generally, the trends and conclusions from the new home sales hold for the new home listings as well, which makes sense given
    that for a new home to sell, it must first be built and listed. An interesting change, however, is that the West
    region saw a -8.82% decrease in new home listings with a 21.74% increase in new home sales. This suggests
    that developers were leaving the region and slowing down developments there - likely due to high cost, land shortages, market saturation, or other factors - 
    even though new homes in the region are selling at increasing rates. Another interesting note is that while Midwest new home sales did not increase 
    in the early 2000s, Midwest new home listings did, implying that developers saw potential in developing the area, but did not get a positive
    response from the market, similar to what happened towards the end of the Cold War with the Northeast increase in new home listings without a 
    corresponding increase in new home sales.
    <br><br>
    <b> Limitations and Potential Extensions </b>
    <br><br>
    I am satisfied with the results of this project, as I was able to use the plot and map visualizations to identify 
    change in the 
    various regions due to the named events, as well as overall change from 1973 to 2021, and I feel like I was able to
    successfully answer my research questions. There 
    were, however, some limatations I encountered, such as not being able to implement a good layered map or create a high 
    quality slider bar version of the maps. If I were to redo this project I would likely at least consider a different visualization 
    packages or tools that could be used to make interactive and/or animated visuals, although 
    with Folium I was still able to produce quality maps showing a specific year's value or the change between two years.
    <br><br>
    Exentending off of this research, the direction I would take this project would be sourcing or gathering
    more granular data, and potentially more statistics such as mean days on the market and mean percent sale above (or below) 
    list. As explained in the data section, the Census Bureau was the best free, historical real estate dataset I was able to get, 
    but I think it would be interesting to redo this with data for each state, and also for the entire real estate market, not just
    new homes. New home median prices likely reflect the overall market median prices fairly well, but as seen in the results, 
    there are cases where
    new home sales and listings may not mirror the overall market sales and listings, so it could be beneficial to expand the scope
    of the data to all new and existing homes.
