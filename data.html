    The data for this project is from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/historical_data/index.html"> 
        U.S. Census Bureau</a>, and the available datasets include number of houses sold, number of houses for sale, and mean 
        and median sale prices. This data pertains only to newly built single-family homes, and 
        not existing ones or new multifamily homes, however, metrics relating to the new build 
        segment of the real estate market can still be used to make inferences about the market as a whole. New home sale prices often 
        vary up and down with existing home sale prices, and increased listings and sales of new homes can indicate the strength of the
        entire market since it still reflects individuals' overall ability and willingness to purchase homes in the given economic climate, 
        as well as developers' confidence that homes will be bought.  The data generally goes back to the 1960s or 1970s depending on the statistic, and 
        the exact temporal scope of the project is part of the discussion below.
        Another consideration with this data source is that the information is not very granular and comes divided into only four
        regions for the entire country - Northeast, South, Midwest, West - as seen below:

    While clustering the U.S. into just four groups is not ideal, I checked many sources for viable datasets including, but not limited to,
    U.S. Government pages like
    the Census Bureau and Department of Housing and Urban Development and private real estate websites including Realtor.com,
    Zillow, Redfin, and the National Association of Realtors. However, the selected Census Bureau dataset was the only one that
    went back a significant number of decades and would allow me to evaluate change over a significant period of time. Many of the 
    other available datasets separated the data by states but only went back to the mid-2010s, and I decided that it was more beneficial
    to use the data with a greater range of years so that I would have a significant timeframe to study.

    <br><br>

    With the data source selected, I choose three metrics from the Census Bureau datasets to visualize: median new home sale price, number of new homes sold
    in a given year, and number of houses listed for sale at the end of a given year. The data is organized by the four regions 
    discussed above, as well as values for the U.S. as a whole. The pricing and sales data is available on yearly increments going back to
    1963 and up until 2021, however, the listing data is only 
    available broken down by region from 1973 to 2021. Thus, to keep a consistent timeframe from analysis I will consider the scope
    of the project to be 1973 to 2021, and I will evaluate the changes and trends over this period, which includes the three main events 
    named in the research questions. These three datasets were chosen since they are easy to interpret and visualize across the 
    United States, and because they are clear indicators of the overall real estate market. Notably, I chose median new home sale prices over mean new home sale
    prices  
    since median sales are protected against outliers, which can be an issue when working with housing data where there may be a few very
    expensive homes that skew the mean significantly. It is also important to specify that the median sales
    price is the median sale price of homes in that region for the given year, the number of homes sold is the total number of all homes 
    in the region that were sold in the given year, but the number of houses listed is the number of homes that were on the market at
    the end of a given year, not the number that were listed at any point during the year. This is an important clarification regarding
    the interpretation of the listed homes dataset.

    <br><br>
    For the geographic visualizations I needed a .json file of all the states, and for this I used the dataset that we used in class when working with Folium, as 
    this was straightforward and contained all of the geographic information that I needed.
